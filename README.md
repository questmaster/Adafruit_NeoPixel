# Adafruit NeoPixel Library Fork

Library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip such as the [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip], the [Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixel][flora], the [Adafruit Breadboard-friendly RGB Smart Pixel][pixel], the [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick][stick], and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield].

This fork is changed to use a stm32F411 Discovery-Board and the CMSIS drivers to drive the LEDs.

Compatibility notes: An external micros()-function has to be provided for the library to work.
